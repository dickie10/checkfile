<h3 class="news"> First-Ever Direct Data Mix between US NASA and European ESA </h3>

<p><b>
rasdaman connects NASA Ames Research Center and ESA
</b></p>

<p><b>
Geneva, January 17, 2014. Commonly, Big Data are seen as "too big to transport" - however, often the real hindrance comes from security policies data centers have to implement to safeguard themselves. High-ranking international officials in Switzerland now have witnessed secure simultaneous access to NASA and ESA archives based on the rasdaman Big Data engine, effectively bridging the Atlantic in real time.
</b></p>

<p>
International delegates gathered in Geneva at the 10th Plenary of the Group on Earth Observations, GEO, to discuss future steps to create societal value from innovative hi-tech tools and data. On this occasion, a first-ever direct and real-time mixing of NASA and ESA data was demonstrated. The Web client on a laptop in Geneva accessed the NASA server to fetch a color image taken by a NASA drone, Ikhana, while it was supporting local firefighters combatting large bushfires in California. From ESA, an elevation model giving height information about the Californian hills was retrieved, originally obtained from a radar satellite. Both were combined in the browser to a 3-D landscape that could be zoomed into and viewed from all sides, similar to a virtual globe like GoogleEarth.
</p>

<p>
The client made use of the OGC Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) standard, a language that allows clients to task servers with processing and filtering on massive spatio-temporal data assets, such as satellite image or climate data sets. Access to the servers on both sides of the Atlantic was accomplished despite both machines are heavily secured by their operators. Not that security was compromised â€“ the resulting work from the GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot (AIP) 6 showed that security-interoperable access is possible via so-called Access Management Federation setup. It establishes a well-defined level of trust between parties and supports Single-Sign-On: A user logging into at one organization of the federation will be trusted by all other members of the federation to perform managed access - and nothing else.
</p>

<p>
An international collaboration made this transatlantic gathering possible. Jacobs University and rasdaman GmbH provided the Big Raster Analytics engine, rasdaman, which NASA Ames Research Center and ESA are running on their operational servers. Secure Dimensions provided the integrated, overarching security tools. MEEO performed data ingest at ESA. Partners met during their collaboration in the OGC standards development and international research collaborations.
</p><p>
Altogether, this unique technology demonstration paves the way for services merging data across data centers, nations, continents - ultimately, across the planet.
