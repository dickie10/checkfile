<h3 class="news">Release of rasdaman 9.1 Brings More Performance, Functionality </h3><p><b>
Version 9.1 of the pioneer Array Database, rasdaman, is now available fordownload. It represents yet another important increase in performance, functionality, and OGC standards support.
</b></p><p>
After relentless community efforts over the last months, version 9.1 of rasdaman is now available from the open-source portal <a href="http://ea.newscpt4.de/_la.php?&nid=3D2343622&sid=3D196282272&lid=3D9447232&enc=3D687474703a2f2f7777772e72617364616d616e2e6f7267&tg=">www.rasdaman.org</a>. Dimitar Misev, a core developer of rasdaman, announced the news on the rasdaman list indicating a series of highly pertinent enhancements.
</p><p>
One set of new features concerns functionality and performance, it includes: External tool support is available for R and python; queries automatically respect null / nodata values; based on user experience, new functionality has been added which specifically eases and accelerates massive timeseries analysis; a new client/server protocol boosting performance and scalability; type management has been simplified by integrating it with the query language.
</p><p>
Further, support for OGC standards has been broadened: WCS-T, the forthcoming OGC standard for Web-based Big Data maintenance and mashups, is fully implemented; support for WMS 1.3 has been added; the WCS Web client offers comprehensive support for WCS Core and all Extensions; and WCPS is prepared for the forthcoming version 2.0 of the standard which is currentlyunder preparation.
</p><p>
Notably, the rasdaman company keeps on contributing code. In addition to manifold detail code enhancements, with version 9.1 null/nodata support has been released from the commercial to the open-source version, a feature which has been repeatedly been asked for by the data science community.These contributions have been made possible through EU funded projects PublicaMundi and EarthServer-2.
</p><p>
At the EarthServer review in Fall 2014, independent reviewers attested, based on "proven evidence", that rasdaman will "significantly transform the way that scientists [...] will be able to access and use data in a way that hitherto was not possible".
