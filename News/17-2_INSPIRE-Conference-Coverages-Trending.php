INSPIRE Conference: Coverages Trending
</h3><p><b>
Europe, on its quest for a harmonized Spatial Data Infrastructure, is about to congregate for the annual INSPIRE conference, this time in vibrant Barcelona in mid-September. Highlight will be the presentation of the INSPIRE WCS, crafted over many months under the lead of British Geological Survey.</b></p>
<p>
On Monday September 26, "Choosing the Right INSPIRE Download Service Technologies" will initiate discussion. Next, large-scale practice proofs of WCS by PML, ESA, ECMWF, and others will be presented in the session "Improving access to big data through OGC standard interfaces - a hands on WC(P)S session", based on 150+ Terabyte services and intercontinental datacube fusion. Over the next days, you may want to visit the INSPIRE booth and, next to it, the EarthServer booth. On Thursday 29, "Integrating INSPIRE into a single seamless information space" will highlight the integration power of the WCS suite. Finally, on Friday 30th "Implementation and potential of INSPIRE coverage data and WCS" will summarize and deepen the topic. Live demos will be based on rasdaman which has been chosen as INSPIRE WCS Reference Implementation.
</p><p>
WCS has proven itself through several years as an OGC standard for regular and irregular grids, such as imagery, elevation data, climate data, andmany more spatio-temporal data. The modular suite of standards enables data access, extraction, download - up to versatile analytics with OGC WebCoverage Processing Service (WCPS). Based on the unifying concept of coverages, data homogenization and service integration is achieved. The OGC coverage data and service model currently is on the way of becoming the lingua franca in Big Earth Data being adopted by INSPIRE as well as ISO. Both the leading open-source and proprietary tools support WCS, with rasdaman being the only fully comprehensive implementation of the WCS suite, in particular with its award-winning multi-dimensional parallel, distributed array engine.
