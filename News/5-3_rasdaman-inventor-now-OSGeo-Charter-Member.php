<h3 class="news">rasdaman inventor now OSGeo Charter Member

</h3><p><b>

Bremen, August 2013. Peter Baumann, Professor of Computer Science, has been elected Charter Member of OSGeo.
</b></p><p>

The Open Source Geospatial Foundation, or OSGeo, is a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to support the collaborative development of open source geospatial software, and promote its widespread use. OSGeo also serves as an outreach and advocacy organization for the open source geospatial community, and provides a common forum and shared infrastructure for improving cross-project collaboration.
</p><p>

"It is an exciting opportunity to support the open source idea in all its variety", says Peter Baumann and explains, "Not only do the Charter Members elect the Board of Directors, but they also actively contribute in discussion." Baumann is well known in OSGeo circles with the Big Data Analytics engine, rasdaman, which is jointly developed by Jacobs University and rasdaman GmbH, a research spinoff. Research around rasdaman has pioneered the area of Array Databases, which is seen as a key Big Data technology by major database vendors. Further, Baumann is editor of international standards in the field and chair of several standards working groups.
