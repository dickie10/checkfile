<h3 class="news">Honors for Jacobs Master Thesis on rasdaman </h3><p><b>
Bremen, November 2013. Jacobs alumna Mihaela Korte has been honored for her master thesis with the ‘Studienpreis für Mittelstandsforschung ‘ by local wiwib e.V.

</b></p><p>
Jacobs alumna Mihaela Korte has been honored for her master thesis with the ‘Studienpreis für Mittelstandforschung’. The prize is awarded biannually by local association wiwib e.V (Wirtschaft-Wissenschaft-Bremen)* in cooperation with the universities of the metropolitan region Bremen-Oldenburg.

</p><p>
Mihaela Korte from Moldova graduated from Jacobs University with an outstanding BA and MA in Computer Science. She wrote her master thesis on „Integrating user-defined functions into the querying process of an array database“ whilst also working at rasdaman GmbH with a focus on big data technology.

</p><p>
The 24-year-old was honored for the development of a new software technology which makes it possible to analyze large amounts of science and engineering data simultaneously with different programs. These programs are working collaboratively while fulfilling different tasks. Commonly, such huge data volumes are referred to as Big Data.

</p><p>
“While experts are still discussing which approach is the best for the analysis of data, Korte’s work as laid the foundations for different technologies to supplement each other. Her work has opened new perspectives for research and practical applications, “ comments Peter Baumann, Professor of Computer Science and Korte’s supervisor at Jacobs University. “Areas of application are manifold, ranging from climate analysis to disaster protection”. Mihaela Korte’s programs are meanwhile distributed by the company as part of its raster data manager software product, rasdaman.
The Jacobs alumna has since moved to the US where she is working for a global software company.

</p><p>
*wiwib e.V. is a local association for the support of the Faculty of Business Studies and Economics at Universität Bremen. In cooperation with Bremen businesses and universities from the metropolitan region Bremen-Oldenburg it regularly honors outstanding Bachelor and Master theses.
