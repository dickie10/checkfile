        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">Big Earth Data at your fingertips - this is the vision of EarthServer, an
            intercontinental initiative for unleashing the potential of Big Data through a disruptive paradigm shift in
            technology:
            <ul>
                <li>from isolated silos of data with disparate functionality towards a single, uniform information
                    space
                </li>
                <li>from a difficult, artificial differentiation between data and metadata access to unified retrieval
                </li>
                <li>from zillions of files towards few whatever-size datacubes</li>
                <li>from limited functionality to the freedom of asking anything, anytime, any server in a peer network
                    of data centers worldwide.
                </li>
            </ul>
