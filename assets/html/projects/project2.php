        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">The results of this major interoperability testbed, which began in 2015, was demonstrated on 4 June 2015 during the OGC Technical Committee meeting held in Boulder, CO. The results will contribute to development and refinement of international standards that are critical for the communication and integration of geospatial information. Rasdaman demonstrated the scalable usage of WCS and WCPS standards in flooding scenarios providing a service capable of ingesting, retrieving and analyzing Bathymetry and DEM Flood data.</div>
