                <p>
                  In DynAWI verbinden wir Methoden der k&uuml;nstlichen Intelligenz und des
                  Maschinellen Lernens mit Systemen zur Bereitstellung und
                  Prozessierung von Geodaten, um aktuelle, r&auml;umlich und zeitlich hoch
                  aufgel&ouml;ster thematischer Karten von Agrarwetterindices f&uuml;r die
                  Landwirtschaft zu erstellen. Die Agrarwetterindices werden mit
                  kontinuierlichen Me&szlig;daten aus dem Gel&auml;nde validiert, um die
                  Unsicherheiten der Indices zu bestimmen und darzustellen. Am Beispiel
                  von D&uuml;rre/Trockenheit, Sp&auml;tfrost und Bodenerosion durch Wasser
                  werden an zahlreichen Standorten Agrarwetterindikatoren (AWI)
                  identifiziert und Modelle f&uuml;r regionsspezifische raumzeitliche
                  Prognosen von Extremwettersituationen entwickelt. Aufgrund der gro&szlig;en
                  Datenmenge einbezogener Erdbeobachtungsdaten (insbesondere
                  Sentinel-2, Witterungsdaten) und der Komplexit&auml;t der Analysen nutzen
                  wir die Datacube-Technologie, um diese "Big Data" in der
                  Umsetzung von Prozessketten managen zu k&ouml;nnen. Wir streben an, die
                  resultierenden Datenw&uuml;rfel-Dienste in die GAIA-X-Umgebung zu
                  integrieren. Die technischen Anforderungen hierf&uuml;r werden innerhalb
                  des deutschen GAIA-X Hubs (Agriculture, Geoinformation) abgestimmt.

                <p>
                  Cube4All aims at a commercial Earth data service leveraging the advantages
                  of open standards based data-cube analytics. It makes complex EO tasks simple,
                  keeping simple tasks simple; it unleashes EO analytics and fusion for non-EO
                  / non-IT experts while increasing the productivity of experts.
                  The resulting service stands out through
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>genuine datacube services on several public Copernicus and further data offerings, including DIASs, CODE-DE and further large-scale data archives in a seamless manner; 
                  <li>allows customers to either rent these services or rent their own preconfectioned datacube service (private or public-facing) on own data, or any combination;
                  <li>more user-friendliness, provably convenient for IT / EO experts and non-experts alike, from extraction to analytics without any programming;
                  <li>seamlessly integration of Copernicus and INSPIRE data; 
                  <li>providing configurable access control for data customers want to offer; 
                  <li>offers a particularly flexible, fair, and attractive billing model;
                  <li>APIs strictly based on the OGC/ISO/IN¬SPIRE standards WCS, WCPS, WMS, and OAPI-Coverages; 
                  <li>can be operated on completely open-source software.
                </ul>
                <p>
                  This way, the developer of the rasdaman technology, rasdaman GmbH, plans to expand its business
                  from software licensing into paid EO datacube services on public data offerings like DIASs.
                  ESA Incubed+ enables this transformation of the company’s business model.
                  Ultimately, the goal is to enable non-EO and non-IT users to utilize datacube services,
                  as opposed to, e.g., own python or JavaScript programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Development of an appropriate business model and corresponding service setup on public data offerings is the core purpose of the Cube4All project.

                  In addition, solving the big data management challenges of the integration, processing and analysis
                  of Copernicus data with other distributed data sources from other industrial domains other than Space
                  opens up new market avenues and strengthen European leadership in earth observation applications and technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  CENTURION develops, demonstrates, and operationalizes ground-breaking advances in Big Data and Artificial Intelligence.
                  It gives consistent and easy access to combination of EO Analysis-Ready Data and AI analytics methods,
                  making exploitation of Copernicus data easy for large groups of experts and non-expert users.

                <h4>LandSupport: building Smart GeoSpatial Decision Support</h4>
                <p>
The objective of EU H2020 <a href="https://www.landsupport.eu/">LANDSUPPORT</a> is the construction of a web-based smart geoSpatial Decision Support System (S-DSS),
which shall provide a powerful set of tools devoted to (i) support sustainable agriculture/forestry, (ii) evaluate trade-off
between land uses (including spatial planning) and (iii) contribute to implementation, impact and delivery of about 20
European land policies and also selected 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals including climate change resilience
goals and the key SDG 15.3 “achieving a land degradation-neutral world”. This objective is achieved by the integration of
already existing databases (interoperability) at different scales with the development of high performance modelling engines
simulating agriculture &amp; forestry (e.g.crop growth), land degradation and environmental issues (e.g.fate of pollutants,
ecosystem services). All the above, including their validation by remote sensed data, are be ensured by a technology at the
state of art for the developing environment (i.e. COMPSs), high-performance computing and massive raster data
management (rasdaman).
LANDSUPPORT is applied at four geographic scales: EU; 3 Nations (Italy, Hungary,
Austria); 2 European Regions in IT and HU; 3 pilot sites in AU, IT, HU; and 2 pilot sites in Tunisia and Malaysia. By doing
that, LANDSUPPORT reconciles grand agriculture/environmental sustainability policy ambitions with operational reality 
such as the evaluation of "land use trade-offs" and "incentivizing real actions/behaviour/
investments"; all requiring activities at detailed spatial scale.

                <p>
                  This project drives the "ship code to data" paradigm to the extreme:
                  it makes a Cubesat an online Web data service for real time EO acquisition,
                  processing, and retrieval, based on the ISO Array SQL standard under adoption.
                  Images get acquired by the on-board camera and geo-referenced via GPS.
                  Access is done via a high-level array query language allowing ad-hoc processing
                  and filtering on spatio-temporal raster data, similar to what standard SQL
                  accomplishes on tuple sets.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On board, such queries are evaluated by the rasdaman Big Array Data Analytics engine.
                  Among others, it supports spatio-temporal queries, hence is truly multi-dimensional.
                  The configuration can be updated/reconfigured in-flight, although emphasis is
                  put on automatic optimization, including acquisition planning based on incoming queries.
                  In a direct scenario, targeted subsetting/pocessing of imagery can be downlinked directly
                  to the requesting client, effectively turning the satellite into an image database.
                  In a federated scenario, a client may submit some complex decision support query to a data center;
                  the rasdaman instance there finds out that data are missing and spawns a sub-request to the Cubesat;
                  merges its locally computed results with the Cubesat response into the final result sent back to the user.
                  As rasdaman is already cloud-parallelized, queries can be distributed automatically
                  between ground and space instances.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Overall goal is to achieve a quantum leap in both EO service quality, data availability, and service integration.

                <h4>BigDataCube: Flexible, Scalable User Services on Massive Spatio-Temporal Earth Observation Data</h4>
                <p>
The <a href="http://www.bigdatacube.org">BigDataCube</a> project aims at advancing the innovative datacube paradigm – i.e., analysis-ready spatio-temporal raster data – from the level of a scientific prototype to pre-commercial Earth Observation (EO) services. To this end, the Germany-based, worldwide leading datacube technology (in database lingo: “Array Database”) rasdaman is installed on CODE-DE as well as in a commercial cloud environment to exemplarily offer analytics services prototypically.
                </p>
                <p>
Complementing the Hadoop service already available on CODE-DE rasdaman offers important additional functionality, in particular a paradigm of "any query, any time, on any size", strictly based on open geo standards and federated with other data centers. On this platform novel, specialized services can be established by third parties in a fast, flexible, and scalable manner.
                </p>
                <p>
To this end, several features crucial for operational services need to be tested and/or implemented, such as securing access (in particular in a federation context), optimal operation in a cloud configuration like CODE-DE, support for radar data, and further items to be determined in the initial requirements analysis phase. The result is the prototype of a federation of rasdaman installations on CODE-DE, CloudEO, as well as the (external) EarthServer federation; further, best practices on the use of array databases in operational environments are established. This paves the way for individual value-adding services by third parties.

                    This project has addressed diagnosis in the farm field
                    through Big-Data-based determination of causes
                    for satellite image derived and site-specific variations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    BigPicture has established services to help farmers to optimize returns and to protect the environment through innovative
Big Data technology.
                    By interpreting satellite captured variations in farm fields
                    through Big Data technologies targeted measures, such as fertilizer placement,
                    application of plant protection products, or choice of species to grow,
                    can be derived. Manifold information is combined in such analyses,
                    including satellite imagery, weather data, as well as the farmers’ experience.
                    This way, the processing chain from satellite-based symptoms captured in the
                    field over diagnosis up to therapy recommendation can be automated entirely.

                    Internationally recognized experts have teamed up:
                    Spatial Business Integration GmbH is a specialist in satellite-image based
                    information products for agriculture, rasdaman GmbH is an expert in Big
                    Data services. By combining the complementary know-how of both partners
                    BigPicture has established large-scale automated analysis offering individual
                    insights and support for agricultural production in Germany.

                <h4><a href="http://www.earthserver.eu">EarthServer</a>: open, flexible, scalable, and user-friendly access to spatio-temporal Earth science data</h4>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
EarthServer has established services and technology for open, flexible,
scalable, and user-friendly access to spatio-temporal Earth science data. Accessing such
data ranges from simple navigation over extraction, download, filtering, and processing up to
complex analytics. This is accomplished through versatile ad-hoc analytics suitable for
extreme-size multi-dimensional Earth Science data, based on and extending leading-edge
Array Database technology.
                </p>
                <p>
EarthServer combines both, thereby achieving tight data/metadata integration. Further, the
rasdaman Array Database System is extended with further spatiotemporal coverage data
types. On server side, highly effective optimizations -- such as parallel and distributed query
processing -- ensure scalability to Exabyte volumes.
                </p>
                <p>
Several Lighthouse Applications, spanning all Earth sciences, have been established
with up to 132 TB databases covering: atmosphere (climate modelling), hydrosphere
(oceanography), lithosphere (geology), and cryosphere (snow and ice mapping); in addition, a
air-borne science (drone) imagery database has been set up and a Planetary science use case
with surface and subsurface data on Mars.
                </p>
                <p>
The main innovations of EarthServer are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Substantial simplification of use of any-size, any-dimension Big Earth Data, through flexible, scalable, integrated, standards-based access interfaces;
                  <li>Integrating data and metadata in Big Earth Data queries,
                  <li>Uniform access across space and time, enabling large image and weather timeseries;
                  <li>Web service support for across all OGC coverage types: multi-dimensional grids, point clouds, and meshes;
                  <li>Transparent queries across heterogeneous file archives and databases;
                  <li>Paving the way for Petabyte Copernicus and climate services through parallel and distributed processing of queries.
                  <li>Strict reliance on the open OGC standards for Big Earth Data access, Web Coverage Service (WCS) and Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS), including advancing these standards themselves.
                </ul>
                <p>
Nucleus is the pre-existing rasdaman system which has coined a new research field, Array
Databases. During EarthServer, rasdaman has strengthened its position as the world‟s leading
Array Database over recent competitors such as SciDB. This substantial technological
advance has resulted in a series of awards for Jacobs Uni and rasdaman GmbH, such as
winner of the Big Data challenge in the Copernicus Masters competition 2014.
                </p>
                <p>
A wide range of outreach activities has accompanied technology development and service de-
ployment. Trainings, best practices, and auxiliary software tools have been provided at events
and on the Web. A multitude of communication channels have been used to position the
EarthServer technology worldwide (such as GEO Plenaries, Copernicus workshops, cli- mate
data workshops, standardization meetings). A particular highlight is a 1h TV documentary
titled “Big Earth Data – the digitized planet” (Fig. 3) done by Jacobs and rasdaman GmbH
one in collaboration with German ZDF and ARTE, to be broadcast soon after the project.
While focusing on Earth sciences, this project transcends Earth and Planetary data; rather,
Array Databases comprise horizontal platform technology equally game-changing Life
sciences, but also industry (such as oil and gas exploration) and eGovernment. In the latter
context, during EarthServer INSPIRE has agree to base its Download Services for coverages
on the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS); work commenced in October 2014. To foster
such uptake, industry and authorities have been involved in EarthServer.
