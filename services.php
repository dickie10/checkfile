            <h2>rasdaman Installation</h2>
            <p>
                Leave it to us to dive into deployment!
                Pick the best fitting choice from several alternatives, or contact us for further ones:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>For an <span class="label label-default">on-site installation</span> we come to your premises and install and configure the software.
                    This approach is preferred for situations where access from outside is not feasible or if the hardware is difficult to transport.
                    In combination with an introductory workshop you reap double benefit from your investment.
                <li><span class="label label-default">Remote installation</span> via secure access (<i>ssh</i>) is the cost-efficient standard today.
                    Likewise, this is the best means for subequent maintenance.
                <li><span class="label label-default">Installation on hardware provided</span> is what we do if you send us your server machine.
                    Following installation, configuration, and test (possibly using your test data provided to us)
                    you receive a ready-made geo data infrastructure.
            </ul>

            <h2>rasdaman Maintenance and Support</h2>

            <h2>rasdaman Feature Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                We have architected and implemented rasdaman, the first complete Array DBMS. Since 1994.
                Together with our partner, <a href="http://www.jacobs-university.de">Jacobs University</a>,
                we have forked the open-source version <em><a href="http://www.rasdaman.org">rasdaman community</a></em>.
                This unrivalled experience we gladly invest to advance the rasdaman technology further
                -- doing so on the open-source <em>rasdaman community</em> version as well.
                By the way, as can be seen in the commit logs on <a href="http://www.rasdaman.org">www.rasdaman.org</a>,
                we still are among the most frequent code contributors, regularly releasing new features into open-source.
            </p>
